      <p>
      I’ve been holding this in for a while now, and I think it’s finally time to tell you. Every time I talk to you, my world feels brighter. You make even the simplest moments feel special, and honestly, I catch myself smiling just from texting you.Even though we’re in a long-distance friendship, you’ve become so important to me. You’ve motivated me in ways you’ll never know. One of my dreams is to play Roblox with you at least once before anything else in life because that would mean the world to me.I still remember our very first text, every little word we’ve shared, and I’ve kept them close to my heart. I really feel like we have a connection our energy, our mindset, even the things we love. Your music taste, your love for cats, your voice that gives me energy in ways I can’t explain it all makes me fall for you more and more.I love your personality, your kindness, and the way you make me feel. That’s why I made this little surprise to remind you how special you are to me. I know this might feel sudden, but I don’t want to lose my chance  and the worse thing is I Don't Other Boy to touch you to Like you and To flirt I  Know I Am Reallyy chopped But I Rlly Like YOU For reall  i wanna  tell you how I truly feel. I really like you more thannn JUST A FRIEND.I don’t want to pressure you or stress you out. If nothing else, I’ll always be here as a good friend. But still… I need to ask:
Will you be my girlfriend? 🙈🙈No matter your answer, I’ll respect it. I just wanted you to know how much you mean to me.
